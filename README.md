RU Course Finder

The RU Course Finder application enhances the existing course search functionality at Rutgers University by allowing users to search for courses based on course title, professor, or course code. Unlike the current search, which relies on exact keyword matches, my application incorporates semantic search. This feature compares vector embeddings of the user's search query with embeddings of actual course titles, improving the accuracy and relevance of search results—especially when searching by course title. This makes it easier for users to find courses even when their search terms don't exactly match the course title.
Additionally, the application provides a unique feature where students can view equivalent courses at local community colleges, along with the distance to these colleges and the name of the equivalent course.

Key Features:

Course Search: Search Rutgers University courses by title, professor, or course code with ease.

Semantic Search: By utilizing vector embeddings, the application ensures more accurate and flexible search results, even when the exact course title doesn’t match the user's query. This is particularly useful for title-based searches, accommodating variations in phrasing.

Course Equivalency: For each Rutgers course, the application offers a list of equivalent courses at nearby community colleges.

Distance Calculation: Displays the distance from the user’s location to community colleges offering equivalent courses, making it easier to evaluate nearby options.
